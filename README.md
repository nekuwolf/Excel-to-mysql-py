<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project was meant to be (quick-and-dirty) python script that convert Excel (xlsx) to MySQL ("insert into" only for now) script.
The reason this was made personally for me to learn Python in general and file-interaction using python.
This script was made in 2021 for college assignment, but just now published for public viewing.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Provide an xlsx file</p>
<p>Each sheets is treated as a individual table, and will be used as the table name</p>
<Please>Make sure there is only ONE table on each sheet. Please have a look at the provided test file</p>
